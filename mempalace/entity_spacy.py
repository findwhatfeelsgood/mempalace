"""Opt-in spaCy NER augmentation for entity detection.

This module is the integration surface for the ``mempalace[nlp]`` extra.
When spaCy is installed, it provides statistical named-entity recognition
(PERSON, ORG, GPE, PRODUCT, WORK_OF_ART, EVENT) that augments — never
replaces — the existing regex + COCA-filter + known-systems pipeline.

When spaCy is NOT installed, every public function gracefully no-ops:
``extract_spacy_entities`` returns ``{}`` and the rest of the entity
pipeline runs unchanged. spaCy is therefore strictly opt-in; uninstalling
it (or never installing ``[nlp]``) is the "disable" mechanism.

Model selection
---------------
The model defaults to ``en_core_web_sm`` (~12 MB, fast, CPU-only).
Users may override via ``MEMPALACE_SPACY_MODEL=en_core_web_md|lg|trf``
for higher accuracy at the cost of size and speed.

The model itself is NOT installed by the extra. On first use,
``_get_spacy_nlp`` attempts ``spacy.load(name)``; on ``OSError`` (model
not present), it calls ``spacy.cli.download(name)`` once and retries.
Mirrors the lazy first-use download pattern used by the embeddinggemma
ONNX model (#1483) so installs stay slim and offline-friendly.
